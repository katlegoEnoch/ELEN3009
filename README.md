Software Development II - Labs

The main idea is to hit the ground running. The first minor milestone is to install and setup the compiler, debugger and IDE. We also have to get the test code running as it should and also start collaborating with our lab/project partner using the GitHub platform.

A repository is like a file that contains files, images, graphics and any type of data file.
Each repository has a main branch known as the master.
A snapshot can be taken of the master and branches can be created off than snapshot. Edits can then be made to the branches without
affecting the main branch
Commiting is the act of saving changes to a branch - feature branch. 
A pull request is a message send to other contributors before a feature can be merged to the main branch. The idea is to give collaborators to make changes or even pull up changes whilst their working on their own branch.
Merging is the act of combining a feature back to the branch from which it was created once all are happy with feature changes.

Git is good for writing reports, building software systems, labs etc.
